    <string name="descEuler">Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician
        and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics, such as infinitesimal
        calculus and graph theory, while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic
        number theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for
        mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is also known for his work in mechanics,
        fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy and music theory.</string>
    <string name="descGauss">Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant
        contributions to many fields in mathematics and science. Sometimes referred to as the Princeps mathematicorum
        (Latin for the foremost of mathematicians) and the greatest mathematician since antiquity, Gauss had
        an exceptional influence in many fields of mathematics and science, and is ranked among historys
        most influential mathematicians.</string>
